                <img src="assets/Betty-White.jpg" id="bettImg">
                <p>The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorcée) sharing a house
                    in Miami, Florida. The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who
                    was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur).
                    They both
                    responded to a room-for-rent ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store. In the pilot
                    episode, the women had
                    a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently removed.[5] The three were soon joined
                    by
                    Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), after the retirement home where she lived, Shady
                    Pines, burned down.</p>
